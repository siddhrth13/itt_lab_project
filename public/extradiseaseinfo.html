            The image depicts two bar charts. The first chart, titled "AGE VS
            CELL TYPE," shows the distribution of different skin cell types
            across various age groups. Each age group is represented on the
            vertical axis, while the horizontal axis shows the count of cases.
            Colors differentiate cell types, such as Basal cell carcinoma,
            Melanocytic nevi, and others. The second chart, "GENDER VS CELL
            TYPE," compares the prevalence of these cell types between male
            and female genders. The vertical axis represents gender, and the
            horizontal axis shows the count. The orange bar, representing
            Basal cell carcinoma, is notably higher in both charts, suggesting
            it's the most common among the conditions listed across all age
            groups and in both genders.

            The image presents a bar chart titled "LOCALIZATION VS CELL TYPE,"
            illustrating the distribution of various skin cell types across
            different body localizations. The vertical axis lists body parts
            from 'scalp' to 'acral', while the horizontal axis quantifies the
            count. Each cell type is color-coded, with Basal cell carcinoma in
            orange, dominating in frequency on the trunk and upper extremity.
            The data underscores patterns in disease manifestation locations,
            with the trunk being the most common site for skin conditions,
            followed by the upper extremity and back, providing valuable
            insights for medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment
            planning.
